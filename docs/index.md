# Workflows in NOMAD

Workflows are an important aspect of data management as they enable for a systematic organization of the _tasks_ performed during a Materials Science research project. We refer to _workflow_ to a series of experiments or simulations already performed and composed of _inputs_, _outputs_, and _tasks_ done in a serial or parallel way. Each workflow will have their _entry_ in NOMAD, from which the rest of the meta-information can be accessed via _references_ to other entries and _sections_.
