# NOMAD Workflows documentation
This repository contains all documentation regarding custom and automatic Workflow schemas in NOMAD. We will divide it in four differentiated resources (plus an extra optional **Introduction** section):
1. **Tutorials**: general tutorials to learn the basics of workflows in your specific field of expertise (experiments or simulations).
2. **How-tos**: very specific and task-oriented guides.
3. **References**: references and information of keywords used in the documentation.
4. **Explanations**: detailed descriptions of the different parts of Workflows in NOMAD.
